# FAQ

## How can I fix the app data inconsistency with my store?

Use the `Refresh` button in the [Bulk Settings](./configuration/bulk).

## How can I go to the Settings page on mobile?

- Click the menu on the top left of the page
- Scroll down to `Apps` and find `Smart Forecast`
- Click `Settings`

## Why am I getting the "Please wait for a while to complete the setup." message?

The app is collecting your data such as Products, and Orders. It should not take long. If it didn't complete for a long time, please [contact us](mailto:admin@smart-stores.net).

## How can I test your app?

If you have a development store, you can [upgrade the app](./configuration/change-plan). The upgrade will not charge you. You can check additional details about [test orders](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders). Unfortunately, the app currently does not support a free trial.
