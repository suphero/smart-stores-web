# Quantity Management

Determine when a product will be understock or overstock by checking the quantity of the product in your store. The calculation is as follows:

- Average product sales: 5 items / day
- If you use `Understock days` as 3 days, below 15 items will be flagged as `Understock`
- If you use `Overstock days` as 30 days, above 150 items will be flagged as `Overstock`
