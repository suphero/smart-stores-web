# Price Management

Default price update suggestions for products when needed. The calculation is as follows:

- Item Cost Price: 100$
- If you use `Minimum Profit Rate` as 10%, below 110$ will be flagged as `Underpriced`
- If you use `Maximum Profit Rate` as 90%, above 190$ will be flagged as `Overpriced`
- Recommended Price is 150$
