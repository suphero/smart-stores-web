# Text Management

Text fields management e.g title length, description length can be controlled in this section. Text lengths should be in a reasonable range. Very short text may cause you to not be able to deliver the message you want to give. However texts that are too long can distract the customer.

For example:

- Minimum Length: 10
- Maximum Length: 15

Then:

- Product -> invalid - 7 chars
- My Product -> valid - 10 chars
- My Special Product -> invalid - 18 chars

## Effect

Updating text management effects:

- [Short Title Products](../finding-issues/short-title-products)
- [Long Title Products](../finding-issues/long-title-products)
- [Short Description Products](../finding-issues/short-description-products)
- [Long Description Products](../finding-issues/long-description-products)
